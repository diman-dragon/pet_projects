| [Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Classification Project](https://github.com/diman-dragon/pet_projects/tree/main/Titanic) | This project is a classic machine learning classification task based on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster based on various features such as age, ticket class, fare, and family relations.| *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM), Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score), Hyperparameter Tuning*| *In process* |
| [Technical Specification: "Intensive Course on Regular Expressions"](https://github.com/diman-dragon/pet_projects/tree/main/ford_price) | TRegular expressions are a powerful tool for working with text data, enabling searching, analyzing, and manipulating information based on predefined patterns. In this intensive course, we will explore the fundamentals of regular expressions in Python, including their syntax, applications, and capabilities. Understanding this topic will help you efficiently process textual data, solve various information processing tasks, and automate workflows. | *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Regular Expressions (re module), CatBoost  (Gradient Boosting), Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering, Regression Models*| *Completed* |
