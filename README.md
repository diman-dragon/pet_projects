| [Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Classification Project](https://github.com/diman-dragon/pet_projects/tree/main/Titanic) | This project is a classic machine learning classification task based on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster based on various features such as age, ticket class, fare, and family relations.| *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM), Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score), Hyperparameter Tuning*| *Completed* |
| [Technical Specification: "Intensive Course on Regular Expressions"](https://github.com/diman-dragon/pet_projects/tree/main/ford_price) | Regular expressions are a powerful tool for working with text data, enabling searching, analyzing, and manipulating information based on predefined patterns. In this intensive course, we will explore the fundamentals of regular expressions in Python, including their syntax, applications, and capabilities. Understanding this topic will help you efficiently process textual data, solve various information processing tasks, and automate workflows. | *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Regular Expressions (re module), CatBoost  (Gradient Boosting), Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering, Regression Models*| *Completed* |
| [Decoding the Music World: How to Determine an Album’s Genre from its Cover](https://github.com/diman-dragon/pet_projects/tree/main/Genre_ID) | Determining an album's genre from its cover is challenging due to genre overlap, diverse music styles, creative artwork, and the lack of a direct link between cover and music.| *Machine Learning & Deep Learning (KNN, CNN, Fastai, PyTorch, Scikit-learn), Data Preprocessing (image processing, augmentation, feature extraction, data splitting), Computer Vision (CNN for image classification), Data Analysis (result analysis, data visualization), Programming (Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Problem Solving & Model Optimization (hyperparameter tuning, model improvement), Big Data Handling (large datasets, optimization).*| *Completed* |
| [A demand forecasting model based on master data and sales data, taking into account various features](https://github.com/diman-dragon/pet_projects/tree/main/lenta_demand) | The task is to create a demand forecasting algorithm for 14 days for in-house produced goods. The granularity is at the level of TК-SKU-Day (where TК is the product category, SKU is the product identifier, and Day refers to daily demand). | *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, Keras, TensorFlow, Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, Jupyter, AWS (or GCP), Docker.*| *Completed* |
