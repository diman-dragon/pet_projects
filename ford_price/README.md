### **Project Description**  
#### **Technical Specification: "Intensive Course on Regular Expressions"**  

**Studying Regular Expressions Using Vehicle VIN Codes**  

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for working with text data, enabling searching, analyzing, and manipulating information based on predefined patterns.  

In this intensive course, we will explore the fundamentals of regular expressions in Python, including their syntax, applications, and capabilities. Understanding this topic will help you efficiently process textual data, solve various information processing tasks, and automate workflows.  

### **Key Learning Objectives:**  
- Get familiar with the `re` module in Python.  
- Learn the main regular expression constructs.  
- Develop skills in solving tasks using regular expressions.  

### **During the intensive course, you will:**  
- Study the structure of a **VIN code**, including the information it contains (region, manufacturer, vehicle characteristics, etc.).  
- Create regular expressions to extract specific components of a VIN code, such as **manufacturer, model, and production year**.  
- Parse a text dataset containing **VIN codes and prices**.  
- Solve the **task of price prediction based on a VIN code**.  

### **Project Files:**  
- **`model.ipynb`** – Main research, EDA, data transformation, model building, and evaluation of quality metrics.  
- **`data_processing.py`** – A collection of all utility functions used in the project.  
- **`function.ipynb`** – A function that takes a dataset as input and outputs the predicted price.
