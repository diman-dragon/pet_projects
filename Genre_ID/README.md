Music albums, like books, are often judged by their cover. It is the first thing the listener sees before hearing the first note. The album cover not only serves as a visual representation of creative content but can also provide clues about its musical direction and genre. Is it possible to accurately determine the musical genre of an album just by looking at its cover?

The task of determining an album’s genre from its cover using machine learning presents several challenges due to the characteristics of the music itself and its visual representation:

Genre Overlap: Many albums incorporate elements from different musical genres. For example, a pop album might contain elements of rock or hip-hop. This complicates the classification task since the cover may reflect the style of one genre, but the music may belong to others.

Genre Diversity within a Single Album: Some albums may be musically diverse, containing multiple genres within a single piece of work. For instance, concept albums or compilations might combine various styles of music under one cover.

Creative Expression through the Cover: Musical artists often use album covers to convey a certain mood, emotion, or concept, which may not accurately reflect the genre of the music. This adds complexity when trying to determine the genre based solely on the cover.

Lack of Standardization: There is no universal system for classifying musical genres, and different people might perceive and interpret genres differently. This makes it difficult to create a training dataset for the machine learning model and may lead to varying results depending on the chosen methodology.

No Direct Link between Cover and Musical Content: Some artists may intentionally use a cover that does not reflect the musical content of the album, aiming to spark curiosity or create a conceptual connection with their work. This can make classification harder.

All these factors make the task of determining an album’s genre from its cover challenging, requiring not just a technical approach but also an understanding of context and cultural aspects of the music industry.

Project Overview
In this project, we attempted to solve this problem.

Project File Descriptions:
File prepare_data.ipynb: Contains the data preparation for analysis. We created a dictionary with genres as keys and full file paths to images as values. The data was split into training and validation sets at an 80-20 ratio. Files with data and targets were saved for future use.

File model_base.ipynb: Contains the baseline model. We chose the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The advantages of the KNN algorithm include simplicity, no training (training happens during prediction), and the ability to handle high-dimensional data. The baseline model is an essential tool in machine learning development and evaluation, helping establish a performance baseline and assess whether new models or approaches improve or degrade this level.

File clustering.ipynb: Attempts genre clustering. The results are difficult to interpret, and on first glance, there appears to be a lot of genre overlap, which will make the task even more challenging. The visualization shows the class distribution.
